To run this the user must make sure that their HTML files are in a templates folder called templates. 
The python files and database files must be outside the templates folder but the python and the templates folder must all be in the same folder. 
User must have python downloaded on laptop/desktop computer and added to path environment variable.  
The user will also need flask, numpy, and SQLite downloaded on their system as well.
When the user wants to run it, the user will need to go into terminal/command prompt and make sure that the user is in the folder where the python code is and making  sure that folder has a subfolder named templates which will contain the html files that will be run.
The user must type into the command prompt/terminal window: python thing.py  and a url would come up such as http://localhost:8000 
Go to that link and you will be directed to the application.
